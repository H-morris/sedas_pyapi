# Get the Stuff

a small collection of useful functions to get data from sedas

Requires python 3+ has been tested with 3.7

## Docker environment

Run the following commands from this directory:

```shell
docker build -t sedas-client:latest .
docker run -it sedas-client:latest /bin/bash
```

This assumes you have docker installed. It will leave you in a shell which has all the tools defined in the docker file 
installed.

Extra tools required will happily be added just make a request.
